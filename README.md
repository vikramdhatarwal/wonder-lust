## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `20.18.0`
- npm
- MongoDB Atlas database or local MongoDB instance
- Cloudinary account
- MapTiler API token

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd "Wonder Lust major project"
```

2. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root.

```env
ATLASDB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
SECRET=your_session_secret

CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

MAP_TOKEN=your_maptiler_token
```

You can also use `CLOUDINARY_URL` instead of the three separate Cloudinary variables if your Cloudinary setup provides one.

4. Start the server.

```bash
node app.js
```

5. Open the app locally.

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Authentication and Authorization

WonderLust uses Passport local authentication. Password hashing and username handling are provided by `passport-local-mongoose`.

Protected actions include:

- Creating listings.
- Editing listings.
- Deleting listings.
- Adding reviews.
- Deleting reviews.
- Viewing the profile page.

Owner-only actions are checked server-side. A user can only edit or delete their own listings, and a review can only be deleted by its author.

When a logged-out user tries to access a protected page, the app saves the intended page and redirects them back after successful login.

## Listings

Each listing contains:

- Title
- Description
- Image URL and Cloudinary filename
- Price
- Category
- Location
- Country
- GeoJSON-style map geometry
- Reviews
- Owner

Listings are validated with Joi before create and update operations. Categories are restricted to the supported category list in `schema.js` and `models/listing.js`.

## Reviews

Reviews contain:

- Rating from 1 to 5
- Comment
- Creation timestamp
- Author reference

Reviews are connected to listings through the listing's `reviews` array. When a listing is deleted, its review documents are also cleaned up through a Mongoose post-delete hook.

## Maps and Routing

The listing detail page includes a MapTiler map. The app supports:

- Server-side geocoding when listings are created or updated.
- Browser-side geocoding fallback if coordinates are missing.
- Destination marker on the listing location.
- Current-location routing after the user clicks the Go button.
- Route drawing through OSRM.
- Google Maps fallback link if route drawing fails.

Current-location routing requires:

- Browser location permission.
- `localhost` or HTTPS.
- A valid MapTiler token.
- A route available through OSRM.

## Image Uploads

Listing images are uploaded through Multer and stored in Cloudinary using `multer-storage-cloudinary`.

The configured Cloudinary folder is:

```text
wanderlust_DEV
```

Supported image formats:

- JPG
- JPEG
- PNG

## Error Handling

The app uses:

- `wrapAsync` to forward async errors to Express error middleware.
- `ExpressError` for intentional HTTP errors.
- Centralized 404 handling.
- Friendly error pages with icons and actions.
- Flash messages for common user-facing feedback.

Common Mongoose `CastError` cases are converted into user-friendly 404 responses.

## Deployment Notes

The live app is deployed at:

```text
https://wanderlust-zwvw.onrender.com
```

For Render deployment, configure environment variables in the Render dashboard. At minimum:

```env
ATLASDB_URL=...
SECRET=...
CLOUD_NAME=...
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...
MAP_TOKEN=...
NODE_ENV=production
```

Recommended Render settings:

```text
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: node app.js
```

## Known Notes

- The current `package.json` does not define a `start` script, so use `node app.js` unless you add one.
- The test script is currently a placeholder.
- OSRM is a public routing service, so route availability and response speed can vary.
- Browser geolocation will not work on insecure non-localhost origins.
